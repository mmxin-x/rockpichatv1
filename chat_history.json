It has two protons and no neutrons, making it the lightest element. Its electron configuration is [He]2s², which means it has two valence electrons in its outer shell. Helium is known for being non-reactive and highly stable, and it is used in various applications, including lighting (as a noble gas for arc lamps), balloons, and as part of the atmosphere. It plays a crucial role in technologies like fusion research and cryogenics."},{"sender":"user","text":"tell me about hydrogen atom"},{"sender":"bot","text":"<think>\nOkay, the user asked about hydrogen atoms. Let me start by recalling what I know about hydrogen. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, so it's just one proton. Its symbol is H. The electron configuration for hydrogen is [He]2s¹, which means it has one electron in its outer shell.\n\nI should mention that hydrogen is the simplest element and plays a key role in all living organisms. It's involved in chemical reactions and is essential for combustion and energy production. Also, it's a highly reactive gas at standard temperature and pressure but is very non-reactive under high pressures. Its use as a fuel or in various applications like lighting and electronics is highlighted here."}]}
